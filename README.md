Project Overview: Biking Accessibility and Elevation near Train Stations in Calgary

This project examines biking accessibility and elevation versus the use of sustainable urban transportation around train stations in Calgary. The main objective is to assess the influence of physical topography and infrastructure on cycling as an active mode of transport that may help people move away from car dependency to greener commuting options.

Objectives:

Assess Bike Accessibility: Use distance and terrain slopes to quantify the accessibility of biking to and from train stations.

Promote Sustainability: Identify steep slopes that are a barrier to cycling and suggest possible infrastructure improvements to make biking more feasible.

Inform Urban Planning: Identify areas where infrastructure improvements could enable transportation by bicycle, reducing carbon emissions.
Key Data and Methods:

Data Sources: DEM, Pedestrian Network Data, Calgary's Proposed Bike Routes

GIS Analysis: Perform slope analysis to classify terrain into three categories: Easy (1–5 degrees), Moderate (5–30 degrees), and Hard (30–90 degrees).
Create accessible zones around train stations using GIS buffers to show the area reachability within 5–15 minutes by bike.


Accessibility Maps: Visualizations highlighting bike-friendly areas and zones of challenging terrain.

Infrastructure Insights: Recommendations on infrastructure enhancement, including on-ground ramps or e-bike support for steep areas.

Sustainability Metrics:The reduced travel times facilitate equitable and sustainable transport.
This project can showcase Calgary's potential to further urban sustainability by better integration of biking with public transit and improvement in the most challenging areas.
