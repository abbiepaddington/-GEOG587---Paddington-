Project Overview: Biking Accessibility and Elevation Near Train Stations in Calgary

This project explores the relationship between biking accessibility, elevation, and sustainable urban transportation near train stations in Calgary. The primary goal is to evaluate how physical landscapes and infrastructure impact cycling as a viable mode of transport, encouraging a shift from car dependency toward greener commuting options. 

Objectives:
1. Assess Accessibility: Measure biking accessibility around train stations based on proximity and terrain gradients.
2. Promote Sustainability: Identify barriers to cycling, such as steep slopes, and propose solutions to enhance biking feasibility.
3. Inform Urban Planning: Highlight areas where infrastructure improvements could encourage cycling and reduce carbon emissions.

Key Data and Methods:
- Data Sources: Digital Elevation Models (DEM), pedestrian network data, and Calgary's planned bike routes.
- GIS Analysis**:
  - Perform slope analysis to classify terrain into three categories: Easy (1–5 degrees), Moderate (5–30 degrees), and Hard (30–90 degrees).
  - Create accessible zones around train stations using GIS buffers to visualize reachability within 5–15 minutes by bike.
  - Overlay planned bike routes and pedestrian paths for comprehensive analysis.
  
Expected Outcomes:
1. Accessibility Maps: Visualizations highlighting bike-friendly areas and zones with challenging terrain.
2. Infrastructure Insights: Recommendations for infrastructure enhancements, such as ramps or electric bike support for steep areas.
3. Sustainability Metrics: Analysis of how improved biking conditions can reduce travel times and foster equitable, sustainable transport.

This project underscores Calgary's potential for advancing urban sustainability by integrating biking with public transit and improving infrastructure in challenging areas.
